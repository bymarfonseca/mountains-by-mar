# 🏔️ Mountains by Mar

This is a personal webpage project built to showcase my passion for **mountains, hiking, and climbing**, while also practicing **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**.  


The page includes:
- A responsive **navbar**.  
- An introduction about me and my love for hiking.  
- **Collapse sections** to show information about my favorite mountains.  
- **Popovers** describing the hiking groups I belong to.  
- A **carousel** with photos from my excursions.  
- **Cards** explaining different types of climbing.  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (custom styles)  
- **Bootstrap 5** (for responsiveness and components)  
- **JavaScript** (for Bootstrap components like popovers and carousel)
